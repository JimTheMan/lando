# Contributing to lando

There are lots of ways to contribute and not all of them involve knowing how
to write rustlang ( but [learning rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is fun
and I highly encourage you to learn the basics! )

## Ways to contribute

### Documentation

Every good project requires good documentation. When documentation is missing or
incorrect, a project it can be very confusing and hard to use for new comers.
Lando expressly aims to have good and accurate documentation.

### Ideas

Lando's goal has an intentionally narrow focus but sometimes a focus thats too
narrow can result in a less than useful tool. Feel free to post a github issue
if you have an idea. Also feel free to post ideas for how lando could collaborate
or be integrated into other projects. Lando aims to play well with ecosystems
rather than live in its own bubble.

### Code Improvements

Lando's interface design aims to be simple and familiar to rust programmers. If something
is not ergonomic or an obvious performance improvement could be made. Feel free to
open a pull request with a suggestion.

### Bug fixes

Lando is young. Young projects have not had the luxury of experience older, mature
projects have had. If you find a defect or something isn't working the way you expect it
to submit a pull request.

### Tests

The role of software tests are to increase confidence than a given change will
not break existing code and will shine a light on the blast radius of a design
change. Lando aims to be well tested but is not there yet. Pull requests that increase
test coverage are more than welcome.


## Guideless

### Commit messages

There are no guidelines on commit messages. We view these low value as barriers
of entry.

### Be open minded to constructive critisim

Be open to suggestions on pull requests. That goes both ways. Lando is open to
changes it its fundamental design.

### Be nice

The rustlang community holds this value in high esteme. Don't be overly defensive and
try to be nice to others
